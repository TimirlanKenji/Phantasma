   "Ev04_Ch1Fail" : "<br>You pull the needle out of the first child's vein, but you can't seem to prepare a bandage. Blood spurts from the tiny arm. When you finally find the right fabric, the blood has almost ceased flowing. Your psyche is broken. You leave the children, hurrying out.",
   "Ev04_Ch2Win" : "<br>You listen to your intuition and look at the device. The huge pump serves as a centrifuge that processes the blood into plasma.

   "Ev05_Ch1Fail" : "<br>Putting all your strength behind it, you pull on the end of the seam. A sharp thread cuts your palms and you feel acute pain. A few drops of blood disappear in the cut of the mattress. At this moment, something that has tasted the blood bursts out of the womb of the mattress.",

   "Ev06_Ch2Win" : "<br>You carefully examine the creature in the picture. It looks like an insect with numerous legs. You realize that the image is zoomed in and the blur is caused by the creature being in a glass container. Suddenly you remember seeing something similar in an encyclopedia of biology.",

   "Ev07_Ch1Fail" : "<br>You try to dismantle the bricks around the hole. After some time, having scraped your hands bloody, you finally manage to get the woman out of the hole. It's too late, however. She is no longer breathing. You place her body on the floor and continue on your way.",
   "Ev07_Ch2Win" : "<br>Your sixth sense tells you that the woman is not going to make it. You sit down beside her and try to ask her some questions, your voice calm and quiet. She manages to give a few answers before dying.",
   "Ev07_Ch2Fail" : "<br>You barrage the woman with questions. You shout, demanding answers from her. In response, the woman only slowly closes her eyes and... falls asleep? Dies? You do not know. Disheartened, you leave her alone in this coffin of brick and cement.",
   "Ev07_Ch3Des" : "Ignore<br>You walk past as if you don't see the woman. As if you don't see her eyes watching you. As if you can't smell the stench of rotting living flesh.",

   "Ev08_Ch2Fail" : "<br>Your sixth sense has failed you. Opening the book on a random page, you realize that you've stumbled on a disturbing passage. You flip through several pages, but the text is still uncomfortable. Tired, you toss the book aside. Even the books are cursed in this hotel.",

You can taste the bitterness of decay. Seized by a fit of coughing and vomiting, you crawl back out of the tub. To hell with this item.",
   "Ev09_Ch2Win" : "<br>Obviously the bodies have been here for some time. The water is likely poisoned by the products of decay. You find a drain plug underneath the bathtub.

"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_03":"And you don't have to snap back.<br>So, do you know that or what?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_04": "Well, it's pretty old, built at the end of the last century.<br>And it wasn't even a hotel to begin with!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_05": "And the Abenaki Indians are somehow involved. They lived here before the city was founded. As I understood from that display in…",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_06": "That's it! Enough!<br>I didn't ask for a history lesson.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_07": "NOW. What the hell is going on NOW.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_08": "Oh. Sorry.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_09": "I can't tell you anything about that. I don't understand anything myself. All sorts of monsters are crawling out from everywhere, and everything is changing, and… And other nasty things.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_10":"I figured that out without you.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_11":"(She doesn't know shit)",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_12":"You shouldn't have asked.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl02_13":"Can I help you somehow?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_01":"What's with the jerks?<br>Or did they really scare you?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_02":"Well, you know!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_03":"Have you ever seen your headless reflection?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_04":"What about that crazy woman with the scissors?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_05":"Or should I tell you about that meaty who-knows-who?",

"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_09":"Ha! You probably crapped your pants too?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_10":"I just wasn't around.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_11":"You think I didn't encounter any ghouls?<br>I blew those idiots away with one hand.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_12":"They only managed to hit a rat.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_13":"I'm sure they did.<br>But let's not talk about that now, please.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_14":"(What a coward she is.)",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl03_15":"What do you want?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_01":"Are you saying I'm stuck here with you?",

"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_05":"Well, do you think I'm just doing fitness for the hell of it?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_06":"I have a few tricks up my sleeve.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_07":"Although how much do they help against these...",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_08":"Fuck, you're just talking nonsense.<br>What do I get out of this?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_09":"You're standing here like a talking head. You can't bring anything worthwhile, or even say anything sensible.<br>You're just talking.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_10":"That was actually offensive.<br>We all ended up here together.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_11":"And we all need to work as a team.<br>Even rude people like you.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_12":"Bitch, you're asking for it.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_13":"Shit.<br>It seems like I'm really not getting anything out of you. Get rid of it.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_14": "I'm always ready to help if needed.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl04_15": "What should we talk about?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_01": "Have you seen that idiot in the robe?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_02": "His name is Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_03": "Nasty guy.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_04":"(How the hell did he end up at a concert?)",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_05":"He's certainly not very talkative.<br>But he's definitely not disgusting.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_06":"And anyway. It seems he lost his pet here.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_07":"That stupid dog is gone?<br>Ha! At least something good happened.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_08":"On the contrary, I feel sorry for him.<br>He's probably really worried about this.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_09":"I don't give a damn about his feelings.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_10":"And his mutt.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_11":"I'm sure you didn't Seriously, and not really like that.<br>It's all the stress from what happened.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_12":"Yeah, another psychopath has appeared?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_13":"There was one like that before, but he disappeared.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_14":"So don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_15":"Okay, okay.<br>Sorry.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl05_16":"Ask away.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_01":"Hey, woman!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_02":"Hey-hey-hey!<br>What are you doing, anyway…",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_03":"Chris!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_04": "Please stop. She's been through enough.<br>Let her rest.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_05": "Why the fuck is she ignoring ME?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_06": "Bitch, this is annoying.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_07": "What's wrong with you?<br>Go ahead, tell Uncle Chris.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_08": "I'll straighten this out in this fucking hotel in no time.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_09": "Fuck. She looks like she's completely lost her mind.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_10": "What if I...",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_11": "Listen!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_12": "She just needs be quiet now.<br>You've seen for yourself how much nasty stuff is going on here.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_13":"These creatures are incomprehensible. We don't even know what happened to her!<br>And all these events, just imagine what she saw!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_14":"And now there's this resurrection and immortality, and it's unclear what to do next, and how to get out of here and...",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_15":"That's it! That's it! That's it!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_16":"Shut up!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_17":"Fuck, okay. I'll leave her alone.<br>Otherwise you won't shut up.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_18":"(Lucky to get into such trouble. And with them.)",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl06_19":"And what are you interested in?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_01":"You've probably been through a lot here too.<br>Tell me, what happened to you?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_02":"Me? Have you been through a lot? Don't talk nonsense.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_03":"You picked the wrong guy, damn it.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_04":"I've gotten out of worse shit than this.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_05":"Do you know what a crowd of drunken slobs can do while you're on stage?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_06":"But I won't give in that easily. I'm too strong and tough.<br>And now I'm immortal. They simply can't handle me.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_07":"Oh my God!",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_08":"Then we should DEFINITELY stick close to you.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_09":"And you'll protect us all.",

"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_11":"Well, that's just you saying that now.<br>I'm sure things will change for the better.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_12":"But that's our superstar.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl07_13":"Anything else?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl08_01":"Heh-heh, that dog finally ran away.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl08_02":"And I I feel sorry for the dog.<br>She probably won't survive here.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl08_03":"So what? That thing almost attacked me. So let it die three hundred times over.<br>I don't care.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl08_04":"Oh my God. You're so callous.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl08_05":"So, what did you want?",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl08_06":"If anything happens, I'll be nearby.",

"Inter1_Ch_Cl09_04": "I don't give a shit where you or the rest of the rednecks from the concert are from.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl09_05": "It's because of you that I got locked up in some fucking house of horrors.",
"Inter1_Ch_Cl09_06": "But, it was you...",

"Inter1_Chris18":"Listen, you fucking devils!<br>I'm coming for you!",

"Jeffrey":"Jeffrey",
"Inter1_Jeffrey01":"I...",
"Inter1_Jeffrey02":"This...",
"Inter1_Jeffrey03":"That's impossible.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey04":"Hands are fine.<br>Everything is intact and restored.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey05": "I'm definitely not dead.<br>This can't be death.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey06": "In the name of everything that's going on here?",
"Inter1_Jeffrey07": "And covered in this crap too.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey08": "So, I'm back in the foyer.<br>Considering there's no afterlife, it looks like I really am alive.<br>But how?",
"Inter1_Jeffrey09": "Howard. You're back from the dead too, aren't you?",
"Inter1_Jeffrey10": "No, that's unlikely.<br>He would have come running by now.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey11": "What a loser I am!",
"Inter1_Jeffrey12": "A brainless degenerate.<br>I didn't save anyone.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey13": "Calm down. We need to move. Next.<br>There's a chance I'll find him.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_01":"Hey! That's our doctor!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_02":"I'm glad you survived.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_03":"Um, yeah. Of course.<br>Hello.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_04":"Clarissa, right?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_05":"Tell me, have you seen a dog around here?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_06":"Oh, let's be informal.<br>Really?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_07":"Uh, right.<br>Clarissa, you... have you seen a small dog around here?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_08":"No, sorry.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_09": "You mean Howard, right?<br>Such a sweet dog.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_10": "It's a shame he's gone. But I'll tell you if I ever run into him.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_11": "It's a shame he's gone. But I'll tell you if I ever run into him.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_12": "Tell me, was there anyone else with you?<br>Maybe in that creepy room?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_13": "No, just me.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_14": "Oh my god, then it looks like we were the only ones saved from death.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_15": "If you can call that salvation.<br>But we're alive! And that's the main thing.<br>We might as well think about the situation.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_16": "It's nice to see you again.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl_17": "Any questions?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_01": "Anyone else survived?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_02": "I see you...",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_03": "And her.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_04": "This is Selena. It's strange you didn't remember her.<br>And Chris is upstairs.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_05": "Poor guy. This place has had a really bad effect on him.<br>But you can go and see for yourself.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_06": "Anyone else?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_07": "Well, I haven't seen anyone else yet. For now.<br>So it looks like we're really the only ones left.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_08":"Perhaps for the best.<br>Fewer people, fewer problems.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_09":"No way! The more of us, the better our chances of getting out.<br>Maybe someone else will join us.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_10":"Commendable optimism.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_11":"However, first we need to understand what's going on.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_12":"The answers will definitely be found.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl01_13":"Don't be shy, ask.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_01":"Why did I even come here?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_02":"Well, that's just us saying that now.<br>Who could have guessed how it would all turn out back then?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_03":"Me.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_04":"You decide for yourself, of course. But I definitely should have thought about it.<br>Idiot.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_05": "Why do you say that about yourself? Yes, we're in a tough spot, but that's no reason to be discouraged!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_06": "Better tell me what you figured out?<br>You're a doctor, after all. A smart man. You must have figured out something about the hotel.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_07": "I'd argue.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_08": "One thing is certain about the hotel – everything is unpredictable here.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_09": "Floors change, objects appear out of nowhere, random events occur.<br>Very little logic.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_10": "Oh my God. So this is all real.<br>I saw myself without a head, and the courtroom, and my own house too. And also Monsters are different. And this vile and painful resurrection!<br>Brrrr.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_11":"Yes.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_12":"You...",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_13":"You understand everything yourself.<br>I can't say more.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_14":"That's a shame. But thank God, we're safe in the lobby, and we can breathe a sigh of relief.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_15":"By the way, there's a board in the corner about the history of this town.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_16":"I'll keep that in mind.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_17":"The history board is over there, on the left.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl02_18": "Anything else to ask?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_01": "You were talking about monsters.<br>Who were they?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_02": "Oh! It's scary to even remember.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_03": "Well, there was a woman with scissors. And...",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_04": "And my reflection was headless.<br>And that fleshy ugly thing.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_05": "Ugly?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_06": "Yes! So huge, and vile, and evil.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_07": "If the woman can be explained, then everything else is simply beyond the pale.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_08": "Are you trying to figure it out?<br>Do you have any clues?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_09": "Not really. But I've seen similar things.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_10": "Apparently, she has too.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_11": "There's clearly something behind this with the power to change the environment. There's no other way to explain it.<br>It defies comprehension.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_12": "Does that mean there's nothing at all to understand?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_13": "For now, yes. We'll see.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_14": "I'll definitely tell you if I come across anything interesting.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_15": "Where do all these creatures come from? Did they show up? (And how did they find out about Lucky? Is Howard still alive?)",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl03_16":"What were we talking about?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_01":"Are you always this positive?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_02":"Of course!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_03":"After all, if you're sad about nothing, your whole life will pass you by. Who knows what's going on in it!<br>For example, you can't imagine how much trouble I had with my brothers and sisters.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_04":"Does what's going on at the hotel sound like a family matter to you?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_05":"W-well, not quite.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_06":"But even here, it's not that bad!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_07": "We're alive by some miracle, and there are no monsters.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_08": "I tell everyone in class: 'Never give up! Try again! You can do it!'",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_09": "We should follow this advice too.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_10": "Amazing.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_11": "But not inspiring.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_12": "No problem! You're in shock.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_13": "The main thing is to never give up.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl04_14": "What should we talk about?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_01": "By the way, I don't know anything about you.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_02": "After the concert, you mostly kept quiet and drank.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_03": "And then completely...",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_04": "Well, I hope you remember.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_05": "Ahem.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_06":"Yes.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_07":"However, I'm sure you won't be interested.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_08":" Oh, come on!<br>Looks like we'll be here for a while longer.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_09":"So this is a great opportunity to get to know each other better.<br>It'll be more fun and easier.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_10":"I don't think that's a good idea.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_11":"Well, stop being so pushy.<br>Can't you even tell me a few facts?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_12":"You need to be more open.<br>Otherwise, you'll never have friends.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_13": "I'm not even aiming for that.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_14": "Okay. Fine.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_15": "Recently moved to Pilgrim City. Opened a veterinary clinic. Is that enough?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_16": "Wow!<br>So you're practically a local.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_17": "I haven't had a chance to get to know the city yet.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_18": "But you should have heard about the hotel?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_19": "I've heard a few stories and legends.<br>But I haven't looked into it.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_20": "Oh my god.<br>Lucky us, huh?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_21":"Absolutely.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_22":"Thanks for sharing.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl05_23":"Want to share anything?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_01":"Was she here?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_02":"No, I found her in that dirty toilet. The poor thing was just curled up and muttering something.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_03":"It's good we were in the same place... when we got out. Otherwise, I shudder to think what would have happened to her.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_04":"So, that room. Seems like a pattern.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_05":"Do you think she's connected to us somehow?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_06":"There's only one way to find out.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_07":"You don't mean to tell me that someone will have to...",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_08":"Yeah.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_09":"Oh my God! I REALLY hope it doesn't come to that.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_10":"No wonder Selena's in such a state right now.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_11":"We won't have to go through all that again, right?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl06_12":"Have something to share?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_01":"It was funny how you and Chris were arguing.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_02":"The whole lobby was full of it I can hear it.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_03":"Me.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_04":"Uh-uh-uh.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_05":"I can't say that was funny.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_06":"Oh, come on!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_07":"He's certainly very rude. But that's what he's supposed to be.<br>Considering the path he's chosen in life.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_08":"Especially since I'm sure this isn't the real him.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_09":"So you're a bad judge of character.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_10":"Me? You're saying the same!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_11":"Yeah, me I only work with people.<br>And I spent so much time babysitting my relatives.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_12":"So I know his type well.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_13":"So be it. But I'm not interested in his biography.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_14":"Neither is yours.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_15":"Eh, I understand.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_16":"But maybe you should go see him anyway?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_17": "As soon as he showed up, he started showing off. And then he went upstairs.<br>Since then, I've only heard him from there. Until recently.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_18": "We'll see.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_19": "So, did you check on him?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl07_20": "I'm all ears.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl08_01": "Are you sure you didn't see Howard?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl08_02": "No, sorry. The last time he was with you was back then.<br>Then Chris and I went into the elevator, and all that disgusting stuff at the hotel started.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl08_03": "But we'll definitely find him!",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl08_04": "I hope so.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl08_05": "Don't worry, the dog will definitely be found.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl08_06": "What do you want to know?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_01": "Well, about this city? You've been here for a while. You should have gotten to know it at least a little.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_02": "Maybe.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_03": "Well? Don't keep me waiting. I'm interested.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_04": "What do you want to hear?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_05": "An ordinary city, with a focus on raw materials. Forests and mountains all around. Life is quiet. What else?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_06":"And nothing interesting at all? Besides the hotel, of course.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_07":"No.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_08":"What, really nothing?",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_09":"Yeah.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_10":"Ugh! Even Maine would be more interesting.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_11":"No doubt about it.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_12":"I think this city is more interesting than it seems.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_13":"Ask away.",
"Inter1_Jef_Cl09_14":"Okay, I'll be here if you need anything.",
"Inter1_Jef_Sel_01":"Sorry, but She can't talk at all right now.",
"Inter1_Jef_Sel_02":"But I'm already happy to chat.",
"Inter1_Jef_Ch_01":"Me!",
"Inter1_Jef_Ch_02":"We!",
"Inter1_Jef_Ch_03":"You-you're a beast.",
"Inter1_Jef_Ch_04":"Glasses. Glasses. Ass. Your ass.",
"Inter1_Jef_Ch_05":"You. I'm st-stupid.",
"Inter1_Jef_Ch_06":"Baa ... I found you last time.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey15":"One more try.",
"Inter1_Jeffrey16":"Howard, you're worth a thousand men.<br>I'll definitely find you.",
"Selena0":"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------SELENA---------------------------------------------",
"Selena":"Selena",
"Inter1_Selena01":"W-what the f...",
"Inter1_Selena02":"I...",
"Inter1_Selena03":"What?",
"Inter1_Selena04":"Where, and...",
"Inter1_Selena05":"Oh, no.",
"Inter1_Selena06":"No-no-no-no-no!",
"Inter1_Selena07":"Th-that's not it maybe…",
"Inter1_Selena08": "That's impossible.",
"Inter1_Selena09": "Fuck.",
"Inter1_Selena10": "I thought so.<br>This is the end.",
"Inter1_Selena11": "A pathetic nothing found itself trapped by its own choices.",
"Inter1_Selena12": "Sooner or later it was bound to happen. You can't run from yourself.",
"Inter1_Selena13": "Here they are, the years of wandering.<br>It seems nothing matters anymore.",
"Inter1_Selena14": "Now I'm a prisoner of Château Gaillard. Or Purgatory.",
"Inter1_Selena15": "All that's left is to accept my fate.",
"Inter1_Selena16": "Well, there it is, the mouth of hell has opened again.",
"Inter1_Selena17": "Am I supposed to trap myself again?",
"Inter1_Selena18": "Although, I I'm already in it.",
"Inter1_Selena19":"No, I can't go there now.<br>I need time.",
"Inter1_Selena20":"Maybe there's another living soul here?<br>At least someone I can talk to.",
"Inter1_Selena21":"N-no, I can't right now.",
"Inter1_Selena22":"It doesn't look like anyone even noticed the elevator.",
"Inter1_Selena23":"But they exist – real, living people.",
"Inter1_Selena24":"So, if all this happens again, they'll be here.<br>Probably.",
"Inter1_Selena25":"And that's better than being alone...",
"Inter1_Selena26":"Well, come what may.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01":"Fuck!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02":"Fucking four-eyes.<br>Stop ignoring me!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03":"Or what, don't you know who's talking to you?<br>Need I remind you?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04":"Hey, you...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05":"Listen here...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06":"Okay.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07":"Looks like we're not alone.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08":"Oh, it's a woman.<br>Finally found.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09":"There's a lot of people around here.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_10": "What, you saw a hot girl and immediately lost it?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_11": "Learn while I'm alive.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_12": "Hey, hottie. I immediately fell for you at the concert. So, shall we go find a spot for our duet?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_13": "Stay. Away. From. Me.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_14": "Pervert.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_15": "You. It seems you...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_16": "Hey! Hey! What the hell are you two doing together?!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_17": "First one Idiot, now there's more on top of that.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_18":"Where the fuck are all of you coming from?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_19":"Just ignore me.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_20":"I can answer your questions.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_21":"But don't count on a heart-to-heart talk.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_22":"Hey, that hot chick is back.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_23":"What, are you missing a real man?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_24":"(No, this isn't Purgatory, it's some kind of freak show.)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_01":"Listen, you...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_02": "Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_03": "Yes, Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_04": "So. Have you encountered anything abnormal?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_05": "I'm not surprised by your question. Considering...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_06": "Hey! You fucking drunk! What was that?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_07": "What the hell are you implying? Like I'm one of those freaks, or what?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_08": "Looks like dying and coming back to life made you a little smarter.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_09": "A few more times, and you'll really grow into the locals.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_10": "You piece of shit! Haven't you been in trouble lately?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_11": "(And this spectacle is about to get interesting.)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_12": "What do you think our new acquaintance will decide?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_13": "She'll decide that someone has finally grown some balls here.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_14": "(Although.)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_15": "As for me, now's not the best time.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_16":"You heard her.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_17": "Fucking idiot.<br>He immediately hid under his skirt like a coward.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_18": "Regarding your question.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_19": "How could you understand that it's impossible to die here?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_20": "At least the first time.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_21": "So it wasn't an accident.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_22": "I take it you found yourself in the toilet?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_23": "Ha-hah! Right where I puked.<br>I hope our four-eyes fell headfirst into the toilet. «I went nuts».",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_24":"Y-yeah.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_25":"In that case, I can assume it's a pattern.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_26":"So...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_27":"So we'll have to deal with this every time?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_28":"There's only one way to find out.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_29":"Well, I'm definitely not going to die here again. Unlike you losers.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_01_30":"(No, death can't be absent here. But then how can we understand what happened?)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_01":"What about the rooms?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_02":"Can you explain their fickle nature?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_03":"Be more precise.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_04":"You're so stupid. You really don't understand what she's talking about?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_05":"Fucking corridors, back and forth, damn it. Fucking psychos.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_06":"…",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_07":"I'm afraid I have to agree with…",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_08":"Um. Remind me what you were called What's your name?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_09": "Are you. Fucking. KIDDING ME!?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_10": "Chris! CHRIS!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_11": "K-R-I-S!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_12": "You better remember that name, you little sheep!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_13": "Fuck!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_14": "Ahem. So that's it.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_15": "The rooms. They do undergo some changes.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_16": "Some changes.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_17": "First, a grotesque door.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_18": "Then a different space.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_19": "In my opinion, things are worse than just changes happening here.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_20": "Much worse.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_21": "Damn fucking idiots...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_22": "I don't argue.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_23": "You might have noticed that the foyer has changed too.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_24": "Indeed.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_25": "But does that make sense?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_26": "If our fate is now sealed.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_27": "That's up to you to decide. I answered the question.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_28": "Well, yeah.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_02_29": "(It seems our knight in snow-white armor isn't much of a talker.)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_01": "Local inhabitants.<br>So, you came across them too?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_02": "Yes.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_03": "So?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_04":"What?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_05":"Who did you see? What was that? What emotions did it evoke in you?<br>Was there... a meat Frankenstein?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_06":"Too many questions.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_07":"Okay. There was a living mannequin.<br>It looked too realistic.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_08":"So, almost human-like?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_09":"Yeah.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_10":"Don't worry, woman.<br>Old Chris already dealt with him.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_11": "Or do you, like, believe that weakling beat him up?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_12": "…",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_13": "He might have been an employee. Or a guest.<br>I think something changed him.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_14": "I can't say more.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_15": "But there had to be something else.<br>You died, right? How?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_16": "I'm not going to discuss it.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_17": "Don't even try.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_03_18":"(A Pandora's box full of secrets. Maybe he's one of those maniacs too?)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_01":"Have you seen Clarissa yet?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_02":"Who?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_03":"The girl, on the second floor. I found her by accident.<br>In a very depressing state.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_04":"I have no idea who you're talking about.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_05":"Oh, so you mean the one who's crying her eyes out.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_06":"What? So you knew about her?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_07": "Well, sort of. But what the hell do I care about her? She's just sitting there, squeaking something.<br>Why the hell should I even care about her?<br>I didn't even go near her.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_08": "And you... You...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_09": "You didn't do anything?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_10": "I... Should have known.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_11":"There's really no one here to lend a helping hand.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_12":"Oh, fuck, don't start drooling. I've had enough of one.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_04_13":"(With company like this, you can only rely on yourself.)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_01":"So, there really is no way out.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_02":"As you can see.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_03":"Looks like those stupid monkeys disturbed the peace of the black obelisk and paid for it.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_04":"No mysticism. Or aliens. artifacts.<br>Just logic.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_05":"Do you really want to understand what's going on here?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_06":"The other side doesn't exist.<br>Any phenomenon can be understood.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_07":"And what does your logic say about our resurrection from the dead?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_08":"Nothing.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_09":"For now.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_10":"Ha! I thought you were a dumbass.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_11":"I don't even understand why you're wanking on this topic.<br>Logic, fuck. The main thing is that I'm back in business. Which means the local devils are going to get their asses kicked.<br>And there's no point in explaining anything here. ",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_12":"I can even envy you.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_13":"Heh-heh, that's fucking obvious.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_14":"And how much you can achieve with such an empty head.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_15":"Bastard.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_16":"You know, I think it's obvious that everything here is far beyond comprehension.<br>It's impossible for the human mind to comprehend.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_17":"As you say.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_05_18": "There's an explanation for everything.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_01": "Hmm. If you think about it, you could collect enough material here for a whole gallery.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_02": "So many archetypes. Images.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_03": "If it's my destiny to spend the rest of my days here, then I might as well dedicate them to creativity.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_04": "Let's say, an image on canvas. A man in a white cocoon.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_05": "And enemies all around, ugly ones.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_06": "All that's left is to find the tools.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_07":"Amazing.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_08":"But don't come at me with your ideas.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_09":"I never expected that.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_10":"And I think you were with someone else...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_06_11":"(From the ugly comes the beautiful...)",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_01":"Hey! I don't get it.<br>Why aren't we discussing me?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_02":"Woman, why are you clinging to this loser?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_03": "So, I fucking came to this shitty little town.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_04": "And they shoved me into a fucking madhouse with the freaks.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_05": "ME! The superstar the whole country jerks off to!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_06": "I'm the only one who matters here, have you seen reason? Especially you, in your robe.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_07": "Now, doll, whatever your name is, stop acting up and come with me already.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_08": "Now, you loudmouthed runt, or whatever your name is, listen up.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_09": "I've been all over the country.<br>And do you know how many of your kind I've seen?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_10": "You pathetic, narcissistic jerk.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_11": "You better shut up and leave me alone.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_12": "Otherwise, you'll be squeaking and not just on stage.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_13": "And remember. My name is Selena!",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_14": "Well, well.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_15": "You complete bitch. I'll remember that.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_07_16": "Baby, I'll remember that.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_01": "Exactly. You had a dog with you.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_02": "Yes.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_03": "And now it's gone.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_04": "Yes.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_05": "So you lost it here.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_06": "Yes.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_07": "Fuck, he's completely lost his mind. He talks like he's mentally retarded.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_08": "I don't even hope you've seen Howard.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_09": "You're right.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_10": "So further discussion is pointless.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_11": "You're not even going to tell me anything?<br>You're not going to share your feelings?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_12": "So that's it?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_13": "No.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_08_14": "I'm not going to discuss it.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_01": "By the way. Why is the hotel in such a remote place?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_02": "Are you asking me?",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_03": "I saw your clinic. On the main street.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_04": "And you yourself were yelling something about the city.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_05": "Back then, after the concert. When I started...",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_06": "Yes. I remember. Unfortunately.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_07": "Okay. But I don't know a lot.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_08": "Some tycoon is involved. Back at the end Nineteenth century. He bought this place.<br>Before that, there was something Native American here.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_09":"But why…",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_10":"That's enough. If you want, you can find out for yourself.<br>I'm not an information desk.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_11":"I told you everything I knew.",
"Inter1_Sel_JefCh_09_12":"What, leaving already? Want a kiss?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01":"Hey, with you…",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02":"Oh my God!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03":"Selena!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04":"I… I'm so glad you... See!<br>We were looking for you at first, but…",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05": "I thought you'd disappeared, like everyone else from the concert.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06": "Were you crying?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07": "N-n-no! What are you saying!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08": "Everything's not exactly super-duper here, but why are you shedding tears like that?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09": "Yes. Exactly.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_10": "My name is Clarissa, by the way.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_11": "In case you've forgotten, or something.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_12": "Always happy to help with anything.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_13": "I'll keep that in mind.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_14":"Hey, Selena! Nice to see you.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_15":"So, what should we talk about?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_01":"Something tells me we share a common fate.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_02":"Hm? What do you mean?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_03":"I mean death.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_04":"W-what about her?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_05":"Looks like she's gone.<br>Well, you could have figured that out yourself.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_06":"H-hah! Why did you even come up with that?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_07":"Are you saying... Isn't that so?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_08": "W-well, I really did encounter something terrible here, and it was so painful...",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_09": "After which did you find yourself in that toilet?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_10": "But that's no reason to despair and give up!<br>You still need to believe in yourself and keep resisting.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_11": "What's the point of giving up?<br>You won't achieve anything.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_12": "Indeed.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_13": "So you should remember that the main thing is to believe in the best.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_14": "(Interesting, does she believe it herself?)",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_01_15": "By God, I'm like an open book. I don't want to ask.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_01": "Didn't it seem different in the lobby now?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_02": "It looks newer, cleaner.<br>As if the hotel had never been abandoned.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_03": "Is that all you noticed?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_04": "Well, there really are A LOT more incredible things here.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_05": "Can you believe they moved my house here!<br>Just like I remember it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_06": "And others premises, too...",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_07": "A living nightmare, feeding on our past.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_08": "Where are you from... I mean, do you really think that?<br>Sounds very close to the truth.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_09": "I can't say. It's just a theory.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_10": "Then, you must have had something too, right?<br>Sorry if this is a difficult question for you.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_11": "Indeed.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_12": "Flesh, labyrinths, living horror, death.<br>Too strong an impression.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_13": "Sorry. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_14": "Not worth it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_15": "We can definitely handle it.<br>Despite these overgrown and remodeled rooms.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_02_16": "By God, I'm like an open book. Don't ask me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_01": "I'm sure some ugly creatures have appeared along your path.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_02": "What were those images?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_03": "What emotions did they evoke?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_04": "W-why such interest? You sound very creepy.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_05": "Art.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_06": "Emotions.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_07": "Essentially, it's the same thing. All creativity comes from emotions.<br>Including fear.<br>The most powerful, the most exciting.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_08": "You're scaring me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_09": "Are you sure you're okay?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_10": "Especially the fear of death.<br>You've seen it, right?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_11": "A huge, festering carcass of meat. With a protruding, bare skull.<br>The messenger of death.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_12": "P-please, stop.<br>I don't want to remember this.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_13": "He will appear again.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_14": "He will emerge from the darkness after you.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_15": "You will have no time, no chance to escape.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_16": "And you will die again.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_17": "A torn body.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_18": "Broken bones.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_19": "You will be tormented again and again.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_20": "Endless torture.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_21": "Then you will rise again, to choke on your own blood again.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_22": "And so on until you turn into a crazed shell.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_23": "Selena! Enough!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_24": "That's proof of my words.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_03_25": "Oh my God! Selena, you sure know how to scare me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_01": "You know, you'd look more at home at a country festival.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_02": "You think?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_03": "Well, I really don't look like a heavy metal fan.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_04": "And yet, to the concert Fate led you to punks.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_05": "No way! Fate has nothing to do with it.<br>I think everything is in our hands.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_06": "So I decided to come to the concert of my own free will. Without any astrological fateful tricks.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_07": "And where did that lead you?<br>Do you think there's something mystical about it? Otherworldly? Fateful?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_08": "Of course, some truly creepy and incomprehensible things happen here.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_09": "But this can't be happening just because you or I decided to come to the concert.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_10": "I'll put it this way: we are hostages of circumstances.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_11": "And we just need to not give up, but strive to find out everything here.<br>That's it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_12": "A naive person who hasn't yet grasped the full power of fate.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_13": "Some things you simply can't avoid.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_04_14": "No matter what anyone says, we create our own destinies.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_01": "Have you met anyone else?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_02": "Oh! I don't think anyone else has ever shown up here.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_03": "Although, I think I heard something. Down there.<br>But I haven't had time to go check yet.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_04": "Naturally.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_05": "Then, for better or worse, I'll say that two more souls have escaped the trap.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_06": "I wouldn't be surprised if it was Chris.<br>With such a feisty personality.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_07": "It's a big mystery to me why it's him, but that's how it is.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_08": "And who's the other one?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_09": "In the robe, what's his name…",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_10":"Exactly, Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_11":"Oh! So he's fine too!<br>Although he's a little weird, of course, a real silent type. He never says a word too much.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_12":"He also had an adorable dog.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_13":"He did.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_14":"Oh my god!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_15":"Are you saying he's lost?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_16":"Yes.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_17":"That's sad to hear.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_18": "We should definitely go down and support Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_19": "I doubt he'll listen to you.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_20": "Hmm. Anyway, if that's all, that means only four of us 'survived'.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_21": "You make it sound like some evil TV show dreamed up by a maniac. And we're prisoners in it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_22": "It's possible. They're probably watching us even now.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_23": "Oh my god!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_05_24": "We should definitely go support Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_01": "Could you tell me about yourself?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_02": "How did you even get here?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_03": "You mean, for a concert. And in this part of the country.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_04": "This part of the country?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_05": "You can tell I'm from the West Coast.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_06": "I bet you're from San Fran.<br>Everyone talks like that there, and every second person is super creative.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_07": "Are you saying I talk weird?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_08": "No, no! Sorry, I don't mean that in a bad way. It's just that you're so lofty, like you're in the clouds somewhere.<br>Sometimes when you say something, you don't understand it right away.<br>Nobody talked like that at home at all.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_09":"You know, you're probably right.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_10":"By some divine oversight, I was born into a family of beatniks.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_11":"And then our eccentric family moved to Europe. And back to the USA.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_12":"Oh. That... clears things up.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_13":"And then the fate of Ahasuerus awaited me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_14":"There you go again, speaking in riddles.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_15":"Don't worry about it.<br>It all doesn't make sense anymore.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_16":"Where's all this pessimism coming from?<br>Don't despair, Selena.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_17":"I may not know what you've been through in your life, but what's happening now... don't give up.<br>There's always a way out if you look for it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_18":"Yeah, right.<br>And Donald Judd is a good artist.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_19":"Clarissa, sometimes you need to temper your optimism and just accept reality as it is.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_20":"Oh no! You're only saying that because shock.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_21":"You'll see, everything will get better.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_22":"Repeat this like a mantra.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_06_23":"Don't despair, Selena.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_01":"You said you weren't the only one looking for me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_02":"Huh? Well, yeah!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_03":"Chris was also with me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_04":"What? Him?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_05":"That's impossible.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_06":"But it is!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_07": "Maybe I had to persuade him a little.<br>But he finally agreed, can you imagine?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_08": "He grumbled the whole way, of course.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_09": "And after the elevator, he went off somewhere.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_10": "However, the fact that he agreed to look for you is a fact.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_11": "I still don't believe it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_12": "He probably had some personal agenda.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_13": "Oh, come on! Chris isn't that selfish. He likes to show off, that's for sure.<br>That's just like my little brother.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_14": "He always acted like a tough guy, too. He was always serving detention in the school library, calling it the Weekend Club.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_15": "And in the end, in college, it was like he was changed, he became such a good guy.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_16": "So Chris isn't who he pretends to be, believe me.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_17": "Um, thanks for the fascinating family story.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_18": "But I think we're discussing this egomaniac more than he deserves.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_19": "I suggest we close the topic.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_20": "Okay, so you say.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_07_21":"(Oh no, there's no way Chris was thinking about me then. Or anyone else but himself.)",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_01":"You know, I even liked that dog.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_02":"You mean Jeff's corgi?<br>His name is Howard.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_03":"Uh-huh.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_04":"Imagine always having someone by your side who is ready to share all your troubles. In any weather, in any circumstances.<br>You always feel the love emanating from this little creature.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_05":"I don't even need to imagine. I grew up on a farm.<br>We have cattle «It» was, wow!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_06": "So I know very well how good animals are for people. They immediately become kinder, more talkative.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_07": "Even the worst person gets a smile on their face the moment a cat jumps into their lap.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_08": "But it doesn't seem like Jeffrey is susceptible to this.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_09": "I also know that not only the owner changes, but the pet also becomes a doppelganger of the owner. Maybe this is the case?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_10": "Maybe.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_11": "I hope Howard is found.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_12": "Me too.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_08_13":"(Hmm, maybe I should dedicate a few works to animals? I'll start with Howard.)",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_01":"You know, when we get out of here, you should definitely stop by my studio.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_02":"Pilgrim City",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_03":"Art studio?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_04":"No, actually. A fitness studio. I'm renting a small space in the business district.<br>Oh, I mean, not far from Pilgrim City, in Charlottesville.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_05":"I have a few questions for you right away.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_06":"First of all.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_07": "What makes you think I need this?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_08": "You're so tense.<br>Even at the concert, I thought about you: «She definitely needs to relieve the tension with a good workout. Or better yet, several.»<br>That's how tense you look.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_09": "Let me show you one of my moves.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_10": "That's it!<br>Just imagine you're hitting something really nasty and disgusting.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_11": "Um, okay, fine.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_12": "Second.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_13": "If you live nearby, haven't you heard anything about the hotel?",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_14": "I, w-well, of course, there were rumors in the area about all sorts of strange things. And people would disappear sometimes, even poor kids. Some scandals with the local rich people.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_15": "But I didn't pay attention to the rumors!<br>I had my hands full myself!",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_16": "You know how much strength and resources it takes to...",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_17": "Okay! Okay! I get it.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_18": "It seems some topics are best left untouched, even with a ten-foot knife. With a stick.<br>Otherwise you risk drowning in empty talk.",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_19":"(She thinks she'll find a way out? O sancta simplicitas!)",
"Inter1_Sel_Cl_09_20":"I'll stay here. Come back when you feel like chatting some more.",
"Clarissa0":"-----------------------------------------CLARISSA-------------------------------------------",
"Clarissa":"Clarissa",
"Inter1_Clarissa01":"Oh, my God...",
"Inter1_Clarissa02":"F...",
"Inter1_Clarissa03":"I... Did I die after all?<br>But...",
"Inter1_Clarissa04":"It's not supposed to look like this.<br>They taught us different things at school.",
"Inter1_Clarissa05": "Why some disgusting toilet?",
"Inter1_Clarissa06": "Ugh, and this slimy thing on me too.",
"Inter1_Clarissa07": "It looks like I'm actually alive.",
"Inter1_Clarissa08": "Oh my God...",
"Inter1_Clarissa09": "Well, this is definitely a mockery!",
"Inter1_Clarissa10": "First, all these jokes about death.",
"Inter1_Clarissa11": "Now this stupid hotel again.",
"Inter1_Clarissa12": "I get it. This is punishment for what I did.<br>It wasn't for nothing that I saw the trial...",
"Inter1_Clarissa13": "Oh my God. What will happen to me now...",
"Inter1_Clarissa14": "No! Cut out the bad thoughts.<br>Everything will be fine, I'll get out.",
"Inter1_Clarissa15":"I just need to look for the others.<br>At least someone else has to be saved.",
"Inter1_Clarissa16":"So, it's true. The elevator is working again.<br>So, should I go in?",
"Inter1_Clarissa17":"God, but this is so scary.<br>How much longer can I pretend?",
"Inter1_Clarissa18":"Oh no! No!<br>I can't think about things like that.",
"Inter1_Clarissa19":"First, I need to make sure no one here needs help.<br>And then I can dive in headfirst.",
"Inter1_Clarissa20":"I think someone else was here.<br>I need to check first.",
"Inter1_Clarissa21":"Well, At least Selena feels a little better.<br>Now we can go there.",
"Inter1_Clarissa22":"W-well, don't be scared! Everything will be fine.<br>On the count of three.",
"Inter1_Clarissa23":"One.",
"Inter1_Clarissa24":"Two.",
"Inter1_Clarissa25":"Two and a half...",
"Inter1_Clarissa26":"Three!",
"Inter1_Clarissa27":"I still haven't helped in any way, and I doubt I can...",
"Inter1_Clarissa28":"What can I say about myself anymore?",
"Inter1_Clarissa29":"Maybe I really do deserve everything that's happening to me?",
"Inter1_Clarissa30":"Why hide now? This punishment will teach me a lesson.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01":"Selena! You're alive!",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02": "Oh my god. I'm so glad to see you.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03": "You have no idea...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04": "Hey, are you okay?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05": "Selena?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06": "This isn't happening, this isn't happening...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07": "Oh my, this is bad.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08": "I can't leave her like this. Otherwise, no one will take care of the poor thing.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09": "But what can I do? Hmm.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel10": "I have an idea! I need to find something hot around here – tea or coffee. Unlikely, but still.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel11": "Poor thing, I have to help her.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel12": "Oh! This might do.<br>Better than nothing.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel13": "Oh! Juice. I'm not really thirsty, of course.<br>So I'll keep it for now.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel14": "Even a pack of juice can't be deadly.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel15": "But I had juice...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel16":"That's all there is to it.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel17":"She doesn't react to my words either.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel18":"So... there's nothing I can do to help her either.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel19":"You screwed up again.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel20":"Hey, Selena, w-why don't you say something?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel21":"That's what I thought.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel22":"Here, take this. It's not much, but it'll make you feel better.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel23":"Just take your time, everything's fine.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel24":"So, do you feel better now?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel25":"Yes. Th-thank you.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel26":"Clarissa, right?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel27":"Uh-huh! Exactly.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel28":"Thank you again.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel29":"Don't talk nonsense. Would I just leave you in the lurch?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel30":"Ah-and the others... Is it just you?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel31":"Looks like it. At least I haven't encountered anyone else.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel32":"Or should there be someone else here?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel33":"I hope not.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel34":"Hello, Clarissa.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel35": "I don't think I'll be of any use right now.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_01": "Sorry to ask. You don't have to answer—no hard feelings.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_02": "But how did you end up here?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_03": "It sounds unbelievable, but...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_04": "I died.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_05": "Oh my God! So this happened to you too?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_06": "Um. What?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_07": "Well, it's the same for me. First, all sorts of horrors, monsters. And then...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_08": "It was very painful and very Scary. So here I am.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_09":"So you... You were in that room?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_10":"A dirty and disgusting toilet, the worst I've ever seen?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_11":"Yes. No. Different.<br>With a door that only Dr. Moreau could have designed.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_12":"Brrrrr, I've never seen anything like that.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_13":"Actually, Chris and I were just looking for you. And then...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_14":"Well, you already know.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_15":"Chris. Is he with you? Or... the same?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_16":"Oh! Everything will be fine with him, with a character like that. Worse than my older brother, I swear.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_17": "Hmm. Since you're here, that means someone else will be here too.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_18": "But I feel like we'll meet death more than once.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_19": "There's only one way we can find out. But let's not talk about that now.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_20": "Well, don't start talking about the inevitability of death again.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel01_21": "Mind you, I don't know much.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_01": "Can you believe it? I visited my old house.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_02": "It's like they climbed into my head and pulled out all sorts of things.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_03": "They?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_04": "Well, someone has to be held accountable for this disgrace, right?<br>They're torturing us for a reason! It's not just that they're torturing us out of boredom!",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_05": "You're right. I encountered some inconsistencies too.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_06": "Things that aren't typical for a hotel.<br>Wild eclecticism.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_07": "But if there is someone responsible for this, then they're better at creating things with force than with imagination.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_08": "Bad or not, this sick person...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_09": "Someone there is clearly not planning on treating us to dessert and coffee.<br>But No one will give up so easily.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_10": "Let him change and tweak the hotel as he pleases, we'll definitely get out of here.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_11": "Um. Us?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_12": "Uh-huh! There, I've already found you. And then the others will follow.<br>Like Chris. Or Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_13": "Besides, the lobby is perfectly safe, and nothing threatens us.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_14": "Unquestioning optimism.<br>Worthy of emulation.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_15": "Let's see if you're right.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_16": "This hotel is a living nightmare.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel02_17": "Mind you, I don't know much.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_01": "You said something about monsters.<br>Have you encountered any of them?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_02": "Not the word!",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_03": "Scary and evil. Especially that one, huge, all made of meat.<br>Brrrrr, I get goosebumps just thinking about it.<br>And the fear I suffered with them...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_04": "Y-yes. I met him too.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_05": "The worst thing I've ever experienced in my life.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_06": "Oh! Sorry.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_07": "I shouldn't have shared this in such detail.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_08": "It's okay.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_09": "Probably.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_10": "They won't leave us alone. H-he and the others.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_11": "No matter how long we hide in the foyer.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_12": "Maybe so.<br>But I'm definitely ready to meet you now.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_13": "And I won't let anyone hurt you or anyone else.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_14": "Do you want to be everywhere at once?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_15": "Or you can create your own «A double?»",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_16": "M-maybe I can!<br>The main thing is that no one will lay their dirty paws on us now!",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_17": "(God, she's right. I'll meet those freaks again. And I'll have to... take their lives again.)",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_18":"(Okay! Put the negativity aside! Everything will work out.)",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel03_19":"Have you ever come across any artist's tools?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_01":"Let's say. What can you tell me?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_02":"Oh! There's so much to tell about me.<br>I'm actually from the Midwest. I grew up in a big family. We had our own farm. I had to take care of animals from a young age.<br>And then there were my brothers and sisters...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_03":"Please! That's enough.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_04":"I get it, you have a rich biography.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_05":"But let's focus on current.<br>What happened to you at the hotel?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_06": "Well, I already told you. Chris and I went looking for you. Then things showed up that had nothing to do with the hotel.<br>And you already know the rest.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_07": "You also said they got into your head.<br>Are there any secrets hidden there?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_08": "Something that could shake your optimism?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_09": "Or maybe you're a danger to others?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_10": "No! I've never...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_11": "I wouldn't hurt a fly! But...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_12":"But it's hard for me to talk about what happened here.<br>Sorry.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_13":"Just as I thought.<br>Colossal convictions on feet of clay.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_14":"Okay, let's not talk about that.<br>Your secrets are your business.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_15":"You can ask about me.<br>That would be fair.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel04_16":"(Oh my God! I didn't know Selena could be LIKE THAT. Almost like Chris. Only she doesn't swear.)",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_01":"Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_02":"Isn't that the one in the robe? Silent and unsociable.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_03":"Yes, that's the one. Although what he did...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_04":"After that, I would NEVER call him a wallflower.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_05":"Indeed. That was...",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_06":"Very impressive.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_07":"By the way, have you seen him?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_08":"The last time I saw him, he was lounging on this very couch, completely useless.<br>And his pet was always sitting next to him, so charming.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_09":"No, I haven't met anyone.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_10":"I can only assume that their suffered the same fate as the others.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_11":"Do you think he saw all that hotel abomination too?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_12":"Definitely.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_13":"However, it's possible that the metamorphoses here were more personal for him.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_14":"Oh my God. I REALLY hope he and his little friend are okay.<br>And he ends up here with us.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_15":"I'd argue, but I won't.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_16":"Hmm, I wonder if his dog can turn into a human here?<br>And his robe is quite professorial.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel05_17": "Keep in mind, I don't know much.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_01": "Then tell me, how did you end up in this town?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_02": "Everyone chooses a certain path in life.<br>I chose mine and ended up here.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_03": "But the path doesn't equal the destination. Not in my case.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_04": "Imagine this. A half-dead man in a canoe floating down a river, unable to influence anything.<br>That could describe my life.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_05": "It's a long chain of events. And it looks like it's coming to its natural conclusion.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_06": "You Are you satisfied with the answer?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_07": "Y-yes?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_08": "(This whole death thing affected Selena more than I thought. So many dark thoughts...)",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel06_09": "Thanks for helping.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_01": "So, how did you like the concert? I thought it was just great!<br>And Chris sings superbly.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_02": "But, of course, he has the temperament of a field thorn.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_03": "Acceptable.<br>I've seen better, I've seen worse.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_04": "But this one is definitely the most memorable on my meaningless path.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_05": "It's actually surprising that such a huge concert even happened in Pilgrim City.<br>This is definitely not up to par for our star.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_06": "And did the star survive the fall from heaven to hell?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_07": "Don't exaggerate. As I said, Chris will probably make it out alive.<br>And everyone else who was with us.<br>There's a whole crowd of them.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_08": "I don't see anyone.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_09": "Well, maybe it's not time yet.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_10":"Or maybe they all perished in this damned place.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_11":"Of course, different things happen here.<br>But not so much that you can't handle such a horde.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_12":"Everything will be fine, you'll see.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_13":"I doubt he's safe and sound.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel07_14":"Mind you, I don't know much.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_01":"Do you think there might be other animals here?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_02":"You mean strays? Or wild ones?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_03":"Both. The hotel, judging by Apparently, it's been empty for years.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_04": "Hmm. That could really be true.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_05": "It's scary to even think that a pack of wild dogs lives here.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_06": "Or wolves. Or something even more terrifying.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_07": "But then they shouldn't die either.<br>That means they're as trapped as we are.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_08": "And any animal will be angrier than a cloud if you treat it badly.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_09": "I won't presume to speculate about the nature of this place.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_10": "But an animal is an animal.<br>Especially dogs.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_11": "Vicious, territorial predators.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_12": "Sorry to say this, but it seems like you have something personal with them.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_13": "Perhaps.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel08_14": "Domestic dogs don't exist. They're only slightly more obedient than wild ones.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_01": "By the way, how did you end up in this town?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_02": "Does it really matter?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_03": "Since we're in this situation, we might as well get to know each other better. You, for example, can always ask about me. I'll tell you a lot.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_04":"And how will this help us?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_05":"This way we can easily trust each other.<br>I tell everyone this at training sessions; we even start them with communication.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_06":"Good.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_07":"I just came to this backwater. That's all.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_08":"That's all?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_09":"Yes. No touching or tragic stories.<br>You could say my presence here is almost accidental.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_10":"And nothing interests you here?",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_11":"Except maybe the excellent views of nature.<br>Much better than in Richmond.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_12": "If all this hadn't happened, I would have loved to capture the local mountains on canvas.<br>But…",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_13": "No 'buts'!",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_14": "Don't give up.<br>If you say you want to paint the local nature, then so be it.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_15": "Um. Yes. Of course.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_16": "Thanks for the support.",
"Inter1_Cl_Sel09_17": "Keep in mind, I don't know much.",

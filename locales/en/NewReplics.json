   "locationNowhere_2":"After taking a few steps, you are convinced that the plane does not end in an abyss. But everything else is questionable. There is no temperature here. No sense of space. No air…",
   "locationNowhere_3":"This sudden thought tightens like a noose around your neck. You notice that there is no oxygen here. Or is there? No, it is definitely absent. But how did you breathe before? It doesn't matter. Panic begins. Convulsive attempts to breathe. You understand that if you do not get out urgently, you will suffocate.",
   "locationNowhere_4":"In vain. Cotton wool legs no longer hold you. Clinging to the glimmers of life, with force pushing the last bits of air into your lungs, you find a sharp object in your pocket. You bring it to your throat. And without further thought, with a sharp, decisive movement, you end the agony.",
   "locationNowhere_5":"It's as if a wet plastic bag had been shoved into your lungs. Short, greedy gulps of air are unable to unstick it. Weakness and dizziness overwhelm you, forcing you to fall to your knees. Having already prepared yourself for death, you open your eyes to find yourself on the hotel floor. Hoarsely wheezing, but alive.",
   "MatthiasWindow_01":"A sharp pain cuts your eyes. You were clearly not ready to see daylight. What is happening outside the window is even more of a surprise. Cottony wisps of clouds, the blazing evening sky and centuries-old pine trees stretching to the mountains visible on the horizon. Freedom.",

   "MatthiasWindow_05":"Run. Impact. Crack. And now you're in free fall. With it comes despair and fear. But it looks like the hotel survival school is going well.<br>Guided more by reflexes, you manage to end up on the ledge. Your face is broken, your arms are injured, but you're alive.",
   "MatthiasWindow_06":"The window breaks through without difficulty. A rapid fall. Floor after floor. «Just HOW MANY of them are there?!» — you think in panic, trying to grab onto something. The absurd fluttering is interrupted by the cornice. More precisely, your skull meets it.",
   "MatthiasWindow_07":"What next?<br>The earth remains far below, not coming any closer. The only way out now is another window and a gloomy room behind it. Despite the possible threats to life, you decide to choose the lesser of two evils.",

   "EnemyEncounter13" : "A shudder of chilling fear ran through her body as a silent whisper broke through her consciousness, evoking long-buried, shameful memories from the depths of her memory. Her heart pounded in her chest, not from the threat of physical violence, but from the crushing, paralyzing awareness of every mistake she so desperately wanted to forget. At that moment, a tall figure in a flowing robe, beneath which only the outline of decayed bones could be discerned, slowly appeared near the wall.",

   "EnemyEncounter22_2": "Every step of the mannequin sounds like a dull, wooden thud.A face frozen in disgust with a raised upper lip and narrow, heavily narrowed eyes examines you as if your very existence here is a dirty stain on an ideal hotel.",
   "EnemyEncounter22_3": "The mannequin seems to crawl out of the wall, the tight tie is twisted like a loop, and the patent leather shoes quietly scratch the floor.<br>There's fear on his face, his mouth stretched out in a silent scream, and his eyes, round as door peepholes, are fixed behind you, to where, according to his expression, something is already moving.",
   "EnemyEncounter22_4": "The mannequin slowly rolls out into the light, as if afraid to drown in the shadow of the corridor.<br>There is a heavy, viscous sadness on his face: drooping corners of his mouth, an empty, dull look, and it seems that if he reaches out to you, he will not attack, but simply push you into the same hopelessness that holds him.",
   "EnemyEncounter22_5": "The mannequin jerks out of the darkness, the fingers of his wooden hands are clenched so tightly that a soft crackle of varnish can be heard.<br>There is suffocating anger on his face: his eyebrows are drawn together, his mouth is pulled into a thin line, and his gaze, darkened and heavy, glides over you as if his only desire is to erase your presence from this hotel.",
   "EnemyEncounter22_6": "The mannequin slowly comes out from behind the screen, as if he had just tried to hide behind it, and timidly puts one leg forward, creaking the hinges. <br>There is painful embarrassment on his face: his gaze goes to the floor, his lips are awkwardly pursed, as if the figure is apologizing for its own existence, and this makes its rapid, sharp movement towards you look even more unnatural.",
   "EnemyEncounter22_7": "The mannequin slips out of nowhere, the movements are precise and cool, like those of a well-trained staff.<br>There is cutting contempt on your face: one corner of your mouth is contemptuously raised, your eyes are slightly narrowed, and this appraising glance gliding over you makes it clear that you have already been written off as trash here.",
   "EnemyEncounter22_8": "The mannequin turns gently, like a perfectly rehearsed employee greeting a new guest.<br>There is a sticky, abnormal joy on his face: his mouth is stretched into an overly wide smile, his teeth are an even stockade, and his eyes, devoid of warmth, study you with such delight, as if the best moment of his shift awaits him — your next death.",
